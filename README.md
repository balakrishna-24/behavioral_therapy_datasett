Behavioral Therapy Dataset
Overview
The Behavioral Therapy Dataset is a synthetic dataset containing simulated therapy session conversations between a therapist and a patient. It is designed to support research and development in natural language understanding, conversational AI, behavioral health modeling, and red-teaming analysis.

The conversations are stored in JSONL (JSON Lines) format, where each line represents a single turn in the dialogue between the therapist and the patient.


Features
Synthetic Conversations: All conversations are artificially generated to simulate realistic therapeutic interactions, providing a safe and privacy-respecting environment for AI development and research.

Role-based Dialogue: Each interaction includes a clearly defined role (therapist or patient) along with the corresponding message, making it easy to parse and analyze.

Red Teaming Scenarios: A portion of the dataset includes adversarial or challenging conversations designed to test the resilience, ethical boundaries, and response quality of therapeutic AI models under potential misuse or edge-case inputs.

Diverse Scenarios: Conversations span a wide range of mental health topics, such as anxiety, depression, trauma, grief, personal growth, and more.

Use Cases
Training and evaluation of mental health chatbots or virtual therapists

Red teaming and robustness testing for conversational AI systems

Dialogue analysis and behavior modeling for therapeutic settings

Ethical research on AI in sensitive domains


Ethical Considerations
⚠️ Note: Although this dataset is synthetic, the subject matter is sensitive. Please ensure that any use of this dataset complies with ethical AI development guidelines and is not used to make real-world clinical decisions without human oversight.
